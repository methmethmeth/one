**What is their background, and thus their motivation?**  
Chid refugee -> boat -> tragedy/horror -> father's hacked smartphone -> uber programmer
Trying to understand reality, why did her family have to die?

Powerful. untrusting. says things just as they are. Hustler.

Works incredibly long, hard hours for corporation. Promoted constantly and rapidly. Govt IT contracts?

 one night tries to use computer and is overcome with a terrible pain. smashes up room and computer. From that point on cannot use screen technology at all. Inciting incident?

**What is their quest, their overall goal?**  
Security and safety via the accumulation of wealth and power at the corporation.
according to her long-term plan, moving up through the ranks, becoming the company's first non-white male CTO.
Which means fulfilling massive goverment contracts. 
Which means overcoming her full-body RSI.

**What is their conflicting goal? (giving them a dual character)**    
Freedom/anarchy for the benefit of all. Vs wealth which requires selfishness, order, systems, obeying arcane government bureacracy to the letter. 

**How do they break stereotype?**  
Muslim heritage. Very strong in business. Genius programmer 

Very effective and aggressive negotiator. Shuts down others through openness, honest aggression and anger. Very rude. Pale. A lot of people love her for her honesty and find her rudeness funny. She perfectly understands normal social interaction, just founds shouting and honesty more effective.

**How are they wacky and exaggerated?** 
Abrupt, rude, short, works 20 hour days all week, doesn't care about your bullshit, doesn't care about ass-kissing at all, wears whatever is most comfortable for programming, bare feet. Doesn't go to meetings, will just walk in to one if she needs something.  

Complete addict to programming. Lives in a flat inside the office. Does not go on holiday or outside. Completely white-pale to the extent that people are taken aback when they meet her and sometimes even when they haven't seem her for a few days. 

"I don't believe you." -to everything

As a result of refusing to stop smoking the Company has been forced to build her a bizarre open-ceilinged office, open to the elements on the 60th floor. Umbrella to cover laptop. Things frequently break, small electrical fires due to weather, sheafs of paper blowing out over the city. Completely anarcho-libertarian: doesn't believe in any form of government or democracy "I don't believe in mental illness. The drugs they give you are placebos with horrible side-effects." "Self-fulfilling prophecies rule the world."

Now cannot even look at any kind of screen without falling to the ground screaming in crippling agony.

**How are they interesting to know?**  
She has an almost telepathic understanding of government bureacracy.

Don't care about social norms at all. tells things exactly as they are, which is very destabilising to normal situations. Shouts through obstacles

**How are they competent, effective and extraordinarily good at what they do?**  
a master of coercion  

The greatest programmer at the company bar none. Single-handedly build most of their infrastructure. Has to program with pen and paper now but does it anyway and is still the best.

Can see straight through any kind of subterfuge. Immediately intuits intentions and drives. Says things exactly as they are in a corporate environment; is promoted rapidly where most people would be fired.
Charity mugger on the street - "I wonder if you might be-" "NO" - slaps in face

**How do they develop to become their polar opposite?**  
Diabolical computer bureacrat TO altruistic naturalist leader. Physically develops from incredibly pale, stooped, feeble, glasses to hench tanned model type

**How do they contrast sharply with their surroundings?**  
High belief software megacorp. Very proper, social hierarchy, double-speak all the time everywhere, career rats climbing to the top via ass-kissing and lying.  

Company is full of businessy hipsters on computers. She cannot now touch or use electronics.    

**Appearance**  
Constantly smoking a cigar, even inside. somewhat overweight because eats what she wants. wears comfortable clothes like tracksuits.
