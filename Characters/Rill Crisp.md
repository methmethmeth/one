**What is their background, and thus their motivation?**  
Parents very focused on what other people thought of them. In private hated and were horrible to each other. Most important thing was to be normal. They only slept together once.

Really likes a good night out. Constantly thinks she knows exactly how people feel about her and see her, and constantly judges other people for their normality or otherwise.

**What is their quest, their overall goal?**  
To be NORMAL, popular, and therefore HAPPY. She cares most of all about is what other people think of her. 
Therefore wants her new boss, T.E., to like her. 

**What is their conflicting goal? (giving them a dual character)**    
To be open/honest with someone who loves her for who seh really is. "I'm a shell, hollow, fake. I'm literally a crisp." "Crisps are real"  

**How do they break stereotype?**  
Very superficial and judging but is very kind too. Is a really good boxer. "Sport keeps you fit, healthy and socialised. I love sport."

**How are they wacky and exaggerated?** 
Uses an insane amount of corporate jargon. Obsessed with normality, follows the statistics of what is normal and follows it in her life. Envisions everything she wants. A perceived slight of any kind severely wounds her. She takes it out on the punching bag while sobbing. "I'm not pretending it's her - I'm pretending it's me."


**How is she interesting to know?**
Knows exactly what is normal, can tell you the strange and arcane necessaries to achieve a certain desired outcome through the alchemy of normality. Always pefectly turned out in every way, unless she feels slighted, at which point she gets very angry.


**How are they competent, effective and extraordinarily good at what they do?**  
Fantastic at seeing what others perceive and using that in her life and work. A wonderful boxer.  


**How do they develop to become their polar opposite?**  


**How do they contrast sharply with their surroundings?**
